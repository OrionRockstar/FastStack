Heyo, welcome to my FastStack repo. I hope you enjoy your stay and bear with me as I update this readme.

FastStack is an astro-image processing application purpose built for astrophotography. Inspired by other similar programs such as 
Pixinsight and Siril; and the beautiful night sky, the goal of this project is purely educational and to gain experience in software engineering and development. 
But rest assured, my code is very performant, memory efficient, and readable as I take my programming practices very seriously. I am 
open to any contrusctive critisism. Thank you for your time and interest!
